Hello peeps, my name is John and I am a mining engineer living in Perth, Western Australia. This is my corner of the internet where I write about things I find interesting and useful. Writing things down forces me to organise my thoughts into comprehensible sentences. I use these sentences to solidify my learnings and hopefully provide value to others who stumble on my writings.

If you would like to receive updates by email, please subscribe to my newsletter. You can also hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjohnun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitter</a>.
