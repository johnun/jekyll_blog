I"H<p>Hello peeps, my name is John and I am a mining engineer living in Perth, Western Australia. This is my corner of the internet where I write about things I find interesting and useful. Writing things down forces me to organise my thoughts into comprehensible sentences. I use these sentences to solidify my learnings and hopefully provide value to others who stumble on my writings.</p>
